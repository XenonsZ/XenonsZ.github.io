My study examines the correlation between being Deaf and the level of educational attainment compared to individuals with typical hearing abilities. It highlights the inadequacy of current aggregate statistics and emphasizes the need for a more detailed, localized dataset to understand the educational challenges and successes of the Deaf community in various regions of the United States.

## Project Description
My project investigates the challenges faced by Deaf individuals, aiming to determine the correlation between deafness and educational attainment compared to hearing individuals. It critiques existing studies for aggregating data across the United States without considering localized data, which may not accurately reflect the educational achievements of the Deaf population in different urban environments. The research aims to create a new dataset on a state-by-state basis, incorporating a human geographic perspective to better understand the educational experiences of the Deaf community.

## Literature Review
A review of existing literature reveals a significant body of research on the income and educational attainment of the Deaf community, with consistent findings that Deaf individuals tend to have lower educational attainment and income compared to hearing individuals. However, these studies often mix data of Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals and lack geographic specificity. The literature also overlooks the cultural aspects of the Deaf community, such as the use of American Sign Language (ASL) and the presence of specialized educational institutions, which can significantly impact educational outcomes. This section underscores the need for geographically and culturally nuanced data.

## Methodology
The research adopts a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative data from state and national educational statistics with qualitative data from interviews with Deaf individuals. This design aims to reveal both statistical trends and the underlying reasons behind these patterns. Quantitative data will be collected from educational records across all 50 states, ensuring comprehensive geographic representation, and will be gathered through interviews with 20-30 Deaf individuals in each state, providing context to the statistical findings. The study will examine variables such as educational attainment, hearing status, state, age, gender, socioeconomic status, availability of Deaf schools, and access to support services. The analysis will involve both state-level and individual-level perspectives to understand the educational challenges and successes within the Deaf community.
